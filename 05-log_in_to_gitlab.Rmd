# Log in to GitLab

## UTU users

Go to the following webpage:

https://gitlab.utu.fi/users/sign_in

Type in your UTU user name and password, and boom, you're in GitLab for UTU - the code repository for University of Turku.

## Non-UTU users

If you are not a UTU user, you can still follow this guide, but you will have to have a user account at the "general" GitLab. You can sign up for free at the following webpage under the ```Get free trial``` button (as of writing this guide, there is no need to add credit card details):

https://about.gitlab.com/

In the next chapter, we will navigate the GitLab and find the field where you have to paste your SSH key.
