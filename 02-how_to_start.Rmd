# How to start?

In order to use Git, you have to do the following things:

1. **Have Git on your computer.** If you have a Mac, you already have it. But it is easy to install it to Windows, too.
2. **Tell Git your name and your email address.**
3. **Obtain the SSH URL** (think of it like the address) **of your remote repository**, which can be in e.g. GitLab or GitHub. In this example, I will show the workflow for GitLab for UTU, which is a code repository for University of Turku.
4. **Create an SSH key.** This key enables you to transfer push and pull content between the remote repository and your computer.
5. **Tell your SSH key to the remote repository** (here: GitLab for UTU).

That's all there is to it. Let's get started.
