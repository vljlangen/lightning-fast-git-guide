# Pushing to GitLab

## Definition

Pushing means that you upload your version of your project to the remote repository (here: to GitLab).

## Pushing with RStudio

In RStudio, do the following things:

1.  Create a new text file
2.  Write some text on it
3.  Save it
4.  Commit it to the repository
    -   This means "staging it", which is a thing you have to do before pushing
    -   You also write a little message, at this time, to what you are committing/pushing
5.  Push it to GitLab

All of these steps are depicted below:

In the next chapter, we will practice how to pull files from a remote repo (here: from GitLab).
